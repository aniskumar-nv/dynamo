"""Unit tests for dynamo.vllm.multimodal_utils.threaded_micro_batcher.

Pin the execution contract: on_start + every fn call (+ on_stop) run on one
dedicated thread (so CUDA-graph capture/replay share a thread), concurrent submits
coalesce into cost-bounded batches up to max_batch_cost (or pass-through when
None), eager-drain pulls all queued work when free, errors reach every awaiting
caller, and the shutdown lifecycle behaves.

``fn`` is ``fn(items)``; ``cost`` is a precomputed scalar that rides on
``submit(items, costs)`` (one-dimensional packing — no bucket_key, no ladder).
